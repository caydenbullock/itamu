            On the nature of my projects:
            <br />
            Many forms of media are made to be consumed rapidly, like a bowl of popcorn. 
            I have been told that what I make is a little more like a bowl of ice cream.
            You've got to slow down to make sense of it all, as the threat of brain freeze is always there.

         {/* A group of gooded people that watched my mom and me grow up.
         <br />
         They would knock on my window at night and left knives in our back yard.
         <br />
         I have always considered my ability to live in the confines of my mind a strength.
         <br />
         If you heard an isolated knock at your window you would brush it off. 
         <br />
         Two knocks? Maybe a branch in the wind.
         <br />
         But if you are lying in bed, pretending to sleep and restlessly rolling-
         <br />
         and you hear KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK--
         <br />
         There is definitely somebody at the window
         <br />
         What are you supposed to do?
         <br />
         By the time decide to stick a finger between the blinds and peek into your backyard-
         <br />
         There's nobody There
         <br />
         But of course there's nobody there.
         <br />
         Just the trees blowing in the wind.
         <br />
         And the street lamp light reaching over your fence. */}
