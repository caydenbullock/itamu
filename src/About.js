            On the nature of my projects:
            <br />
            As a child I was frequently plagued with nightmares, which remained unresolvable through conventional means.
            Through documenting my dreams, I found it increasingly possible to recognize when I was in a dream.
            The majority of my artistic expression is sourced from my dreams, ultimately combining creative outlet and therapeutic utility.
           <div style={{color:'black'}}>
            While awake, I spent the majority of my time in my mind.
            I developed a secondary layer to the world based on a number of patterns I needed to repeat and certain behaviors I needed to uphold.
            In a way, it was as if I was devoutly religious, for something composed of the superstitions of my childhood imagination. 
            Luckily I grew out of this, but my childhood dreams remain one of my largest influences today.

         {/* A group of gooded people that watched my mom and me grow up.
         <br />
         They would knock on my window at night and left knives in our back yard.
         <br />
         I have always considered my ability to live in the confines of my mind a strength.
         <br />
         If you heard an isolated knock at your window you would brush it off. 
         <br />
         Two knocks? Maybe a branch in the wind.
         <br />
         But if you are lying in bed, pretending to sleep and restlessly rolling-
         <br />
         and you hear KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK--
         <br />
         There is definitely somebody at the window
         <br />
         What are you supposed to do?
         <br />
         By the time decide to stick a finger between the blinds and peek into your backyard-
         <br />
         There's nobody There
         <br />
         But of course there's nobody there.
         <br />
         Just the trees blowing in the wind.
         <br />
         And the street lamp light reaching over your fence. */}
